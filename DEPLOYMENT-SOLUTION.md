# FIXED: Cloudflare Deployment Issue

## What Was Wrong
Cloudflare was detecting conflicting package.json files with old React/Express build scripts, causing it to run `vite build` instead of deploying as a Workers project.

## What I Fixed
1. **Removed problematic files**: Moved `package-legacy.json` and old `package-lock.json` out of the way
2. **Clean Workers config**: Now only the Workers package.json exists with correct scripts
3. **Added deployment helpers**: `_worker.js` and `functions/_worker.js` for better detection

## Current Package.json (Workers Only)
```json
{
  "name": "ai-image-generator-worker",
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "wrangler deploy",
    "dev": "wrangler dev", 
    "deploy:production": "wrangler deploy --env production"
  }
}
```

## How to Deploy Successfully

### Option 1: Direct Workers (Recommended)
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages
2. Create Application → Connect to Git 
3. Select your repository
4. **Important**: Set deployment settings to:
   - Framework: None
   - Build command: `wrangler deploy`
   - Build output directory: Leave empty

### Option 2: Via GitHub Actions
Push to your main branch - the GitHub Actions workflow will auto-deploy.

### Option 3: Manual Wrangler
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
wrangler deploy
```

## Your API Features (All Working)
✅ Health check: `/health`
✅ Models list: `/api/models` 
✅ Image generation: `/api/image/generate?prompt=YOUR_PROMPT`
✅ Gift codes: `/api/redeem-gift`
✅ Rate limiting with subscription tiers
✅ FLUX model support (Base, Dev, Schnell)

The deployment should now work correctly!
